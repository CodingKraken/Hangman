If you'd like to change the word list, please replace one of the existing words with a new word of your choosing, otherwise there's no guarantee that the random number generator will call it. You can also, alternatively, change the modulo on the random number generator call in main.cpp, to change the potential length of your word list, though numbers above 32767 might not produce as-random of results.
